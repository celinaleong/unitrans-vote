        Congratulations! The power to influence the future of Unitrans is in YOUR hands.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        On February 19-21, UC Davis undergraduates will be asked to vote on on a support fee referendum to maintain and improve Unitrans service.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        If the referendum passes, Unitrans will be financially stable moving forward. All funds raised will be used to pay for
        wages associated with the increasing minimum wage, bus maintenance, fuel, and all the other stuff that keeps the buses moving.
      </p>
      <p class="flow-text">
        If the referendum doesn’t pass… Well, you thought the buses were crowded

      <div class="container">
        <p class="flow-text">
          Starting in January 2017, the California State minimum wage is required to increase $1 per hour per year through January
          2022, which increases operations costs because
          <b>drivers must be paid more.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          In addition, upcoming changes to federal transit training regulations means Unitrans must hire career staff to train drivers. So,
          <b>training drivers will become more expensive</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          Without any additional revenues, these cost increases mean Unitrans will have no choice but to make major cuts to services
          starting next academic year.

        <p class="flow-text">
          To mitigate increasing costs, less than $4.50/month ($13.33/qtr) is needed in the 2019-20 academic year. As the minimum wage
          continues to increase, so will these fees, until they are indexed to inflation in 2023 to ensure Unitrans is financially
          viable into the future.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          25% of the fee will be returned to student aid as required by University of California policy. This helps fund students who
          are in financial need.

                purchases (replacing old buses). This quarterly fee is made up of four separate fee referendums that UC Davis
                undergraduates have voted for and passed since 1990. The last fee referendum to support Unitrans was passed
                in 2007. Since then, the fee has remained unchanged and only changes with undergraduate enrollment. It is
                not indexed to inflation. Over the last decade, the purchasing power of the fees has declined significantly
                as inflation has increased. The City of Davis provides significant financial support for Unitrans. City funding
                accounts for 45% of Unitrans operations budget and 85% of the capital budget. This funding generally increases
                with inflation but is subject to volatility with the economy.</p>

                audit confirmed the magnitude of the deficit, the causes for the deficit, and confirmed that Unitrans operates
                as efficiently as possible. In addition, Unitrans is audited by the State of California every year, by the
                Federal government every three years, and by Caltrans every three years. UC Davis is proud that Unitrans
                is the LOWEST cost transit operation in the State of California!</p>

              <p class="flow-text">Unitrans is widely regarded as one of the most cost efficient and productive transit services in California
                and the nation. Not only is Unitrans the lowest cost transit operation per service hour in California, Unitrans
                is also the third most productive transit system in California on a passengers transported by hour basis.
                Only San Francisco Muni and Los Angeles Metro carry more passengers per hour than Unitrans.</p>

                8,000-10,000 more automobile and bicycle commuters to campus EVERY day. Significant Unitrans service cuts
                will led to increased auto and bicycle traffic and will further exacerbate auto and bicycle parking throughout
                campus. In addition, Unitrans is a clean way to get to campus! More buses and fewer cars means we can all
                breathe easier!</p>
